## Game Description

This game is intended as a therapeutic tool for treating people who have lost access to their language, either through a stroke or otherwise. The goal of the game is to find the correct word when given a definition of the word.

This game uses [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/) to look up the definition of a randomly chosen word. The player is presented with this definition and is challenged to choose the correct word from a list of four words. Points are deducted for each incorrect guess. A total score is calculated at the end of each game. A player can quit at any time.
